SUMMARY

A self-regulating, embedded automation engine built from scratch using raw C++, integrating multiple sensors and actuators to create a fully autonomous decision-making environment inside a home. The system dynamically responds to real-time signals, maintains internal state, and performs coordinated actions without cloud dependency or pre-built frameworks. It resembles early robotics/cybernetic feedback systems.

WHAT MAKES IT UNIQUE? This is NOT a typical home automation system because it is a small cyber-physical system designed like a primitive organism. It reacts, adapts, self-regulates, uses feedback loops, requires no cloud, It is fully autonomous.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Modern smart-home devices rely heavily on:
cloud services, vendor ecosystems, pre-built rule engines, mobile app triggers.
These systems are fragile and fail when: internet is down, cloud latency increases, vendor APIs change, users expect real-time, safety-critical control
There is a clear gap for local, autonomous automation systems that run without cloud dependence. This project explores precisely that.

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

Core Components:

Input Layer: 
Multi-sensor array (temperature, light, motion, humidity, etc.).

Signal Processing Layer: 
Raw C++ logic with custom rule-based decision engine
No frameworks, no IoT libraries.

Decision Core (Primitive “Biocompute Logic”) Conditions + feedback + state tracking: Acts like a simplified biological regulatory system.

Output Layer: Motors, relays, and actuators controlling: lights, fans, doors, appliances, environmental systems.

Architecture Style: Distributed, event-driven, feedback-regulated control system.
