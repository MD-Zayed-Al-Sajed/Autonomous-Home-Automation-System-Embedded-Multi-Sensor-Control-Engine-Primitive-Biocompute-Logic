# -Home-Automation-System-Arduino-Based-Smart-Security-Monitoring
Designed and developed an IoT-based Home Automation System using Arduino, C++, and multiple sensors. The system provides automated security, fire detection, smart lighting, and soil moisture-based irrigation, improving efficiency and safety in smart homes.

Developed a C++-based embedded system that controls doors, windows, lighting, and alarms.
• Implemented servo motor control and digital keypads for an automated door lock system.
• Integrated smoke, fire, motion, and soil moisture sensors to enable real-time monitoring.
• Designed smart irrigation system that automatically waters plants based on soil moisture levels.
• Programmed motion-activated lighting to reduce energy consumption.
• Built an LCD-based alert system for fire, smoke, and intrusion detection.
• Optimized sensor response time and real-time automation logic using Arduino programming.
